## How does it work?

As a user, you will enter items (e.g., ‚ÄúGreek yogurt‚Äù or ‚ÄúPaper towels‚Äù) into your list. Each time you buy the item, you mark it as purchased in the list. Over time, the app comes to understand the intervals at which you buy different items. If an item is likely to be due to be bought soon, it rises to the top of the shopping list.

## Features of the App

1. Accessible fonts, styles, and sizes
2. Light mode and Dark mode depending on user system preferences
3. Join and share a list with others through unique list tokens
4. Search items by name and recommended purchase date
5. Set personal goals
6. Export shopping event to calendars (Outlook, iCal, Google, and Yahoo)
7. Add items and select how soon the item should be purchased
8. Track and untrack multiple shopping lists
9. Delete items and delete shopping lists
10. A food pun at the bottom of the screen for a touch of humor
